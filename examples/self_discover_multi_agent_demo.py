"""Self-Discover Multi-Agent Demo - Working Implementation.

This demo implements the Self-Discover reasoning pattern using working agents:
1. Selector Agent - Select relevant reasoning modules
2. Adapter Agent - Adapt modules for specific task
3. Structurer Agent - Create structured reasoning plan
4. Executor Agent - Execute the plan to solve the task

Uses EnhancedMultiAgentV4 for coordination and SimpleAgentV3 as the base.
