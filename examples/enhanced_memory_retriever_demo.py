"""Enhanced Memory Retriever Demo - Phase 2 Implementation.

This example demonstrates the Enhanced Self-Query Memory Retriever that builds on
the memory classification system to provide intelligent, context-aware retrieval.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Memory type classification and targeting
- Query intent analysis and expansion
- Multi-factor scoring (similarity + importance + recency + type)
- Metadata filtering and self-query capabilities
- Performance monitoring and optimization

This represents Phase 2 of our incremental memory system implementation.
