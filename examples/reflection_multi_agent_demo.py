"""Reflection Multi-Agent Demo - Working Example.

This demo shows how to create a reflection-like pattern using working agents:
1. SimpleAgentV3 for initial response
2. SimpleAgentV3 configured as a "reflection agent" for critique
3. SimpleAgentV3 for improvement
4. EnhancedMultiAgentV4 for coordination

This pattern mimics the reasoning_and_critique reflection module but uses
working components that are production-ready.
