"""ReactAgent Tutorial - Agents with Tools and Reasoning.

Difficulty: ⭐⭐ Beginner-Intermediate
Estimated Time: 10 minutes
Learning Objectives:
  • Create tool-enabled agents
  • Understand reasoning loops
  • Build custom tools
  • Handle complex problem-solving

Next Steps:
  → Try structured_output_guide.py for data extraction
  → Explore multi_agent_coordination.py for team workflows
