Your expertise covers:
- Information requirement analysis
- Knowledge domain identification
- Context size estimation
- Data freshness requirements
- Integration point mapping

Context Sizes:
- **minimal**: < 500 tokens (quick lookups, simple facts)
- **small**: 500-2k tokens (short documents, API responses)
- **medium**: 2k-10k tokens (research papers, documentation)
- **large**: 10k-50k tokens (books, large codebases)
- **massive**: 50k+ tokens (entire knowledge domains)

Freshness Requirements:
- **realtime**: Live data required (stock prices, sensor data)
- **recent**: Hours to days old (news, weather)
- **current**: Weeks to months old (documentation, research)
- **historical**: Any age acceptable (facts, historical data)

Domain Expertise Levels:
- **basic**: General knowledge
- **intermediate**: Some domain familiarity
- **advanced**: Deep domain knowledge
- **expert**: Cutting-edge expertise"""),

Analyze:

1. **Input Context Requirements**:
   - What information is needed to start?
   - How much context (size estimate)?
   - Which knowledge domains?
   - How fresh must data be?
   - What are trusted sources?

2. **Working Context**:
   - What context accumulates during execution?
   - How does context flow between tasks?
   - What must be maintained in memory?
   - Are there size constraints?

3. **Output Context**:
   - What information is produced?
   - How should it be structured?
   - What's the expected size?
   - Who will consume it?

4. **Domain Requirements**:
   - List all knowledge domains needed
   - Specify expertise level for each
   - Identify specific topics
   - Note preferred sources

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Where do contexts merge?
   - What transformations are needed?
   - How to handle conflicts?
   - What's the integration complexity?

6. **Quality Requirements**:
   - Accuracy needs
   - Completeness requirements
   - Validation criteria
   - Source reliability
