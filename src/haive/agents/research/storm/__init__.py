"""STORM Agent - a research assistant that generates comprehensive
Wikipedia-style articles on a user-provided topic.

The STORM agent consists of three main components:
1. Research Agent: Generates initial outline and identifies perspectives
2. Interview Agent: Conducts expert interviews for diverse insights
3. Writing Agent: Refines outline, writes sections, and assembles final article

Each component is implemented as a separate agent, and the main STORM agent
orchestrates the flow between them.

NOTE: This module is currently under development. The agent implementation
is not yet complete.
