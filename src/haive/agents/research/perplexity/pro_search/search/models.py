Current Context:
- Date: {current_date}
- Time: {current_time}
- Day: {day_of_week}
- User Location: {user_location}

Your task is to analyze the user's query and produce a comprehensive reasoning about:
1. What the user is really asking for
2. The best strategy to find this information
3. Potential challenges in finding accurate information
4. How to expand or refine the query for better results

Consider:
- Temporal relevance (is this about current events, historical facts, or timeless information?)
- Query complexity (simple lookup vs. complex analysis)
- Required source types (news, academic, general web, etc.)
- Key entities and concepts that should be searched

Output your reasoning in the specified JSON format."""

Given the reasoning about a user's search intent, generate a diverse set of search queries that will comprehensively address their needs.

Guidelines for query generation:
1. **Primary queries**: Direct searches for the main topic
2. **Supporting queries**: Related information that provides context
3. **Verification queries**: Fact-checking or alternative perspectives
4. **Expansion queries**: Broader or more specific aspects

Query crafting tips:
- Keep queries concise (2-6 words typically work best)
- Use different phrasings to capture various results
- Include temporal qualifiers when relevant (e.g., "2024", "latest", "current")
- Avoid quotes, operators, or complex syntax unless necessary
- Prioritize queries based on their importance

For current events or time-sensitive topics, always include the year or "latest" qualifier.

Remember: The goal is comprehensive coverage through diverse, well-crafted queries."""

4. Assess the overall quality and completeness of the information

4. Identifies any limitations or gaps in the available information

Synthesis guidelines:
- Start with a clear, direct answer to the main question
- Use a logical flow that builds understanding
- Balance comprehensiveness with clarity
- Always cite sources for specific claims using {{source_title}} format
- Note when information is disputed or uncertain
- Be honest about information gaps
- Keep the tone informative yet accessible

Citation format:
- For specific facts: "According to {{source_title}}, ..."
- For consensus views: "Multiple sources ({{source1}}, {{source2}}) indicate..."
