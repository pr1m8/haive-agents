r"""Base conversation state with automatic round tracking via reducers.

This module defines the ConversationState class, which is the foundational state schema
for all conversation types. It extends MessagesState with specialized tracking for
conversation rounds, speaker history, and flow management using reducer-based automatic
state updates.

The state uses Pydantic for validation and reducer functions for automatic field updates,
allowing for elegant tracking of conversation progress without complex manual state management.
This approach ensures consistent state evolution and provides rich computed properties for
conversation analysis and control.

Key Features:
    - Automatic message accumulation (inherited from MessagesState)
    - Turn count tracking with automatic incrementation via reducers
    - Speaker history with automatic appending and chronological tracking
    - Round calculation based on turn count and speaker count
    - Computed properties for conversation progress and remaining speakers
    - Rich progress tracking with percentage completion and round analysis
    - Automatic termination detection based on round limits

Architecture:
    The ConversationState extends MessagesState and adds conversation-specific fields
    with reducer functions that automatically update state as conversations progress.
    Computed properties provide real-time analysis of conversation state without
    manual tracking or complex state management.

Usage Patterns:
    Basic state creation::\n

        state = ConversationState(
            speakers=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
            topic="Future of AI",
            max_rounds=5
        )

        # Automatic progress tracking
        print(f"Round {state.round_number}, Turn {state.turn_count}")
        print(f"Progress: {state.conversation_progress:.1%}")

    State updates via reducers::\n

        # Turn count automatically increments
        state = state.model_copy(update={"turn_count": 1})

        # Speaker history automatically appends
        state = state.model_copy(update={"speaker_history": ["Alice"]})

        # Computed properties automatically update
        print(f"Remaining speakers: {state.remaining_speakers_this_round}")

Examples:
    See the base conversation examples for comprehensive usage patterns.

class ConversationState(MessagesState):
    r"""Base conversation state schema with automatic tracking and progress calculations.

    This state schema extends MessagesState with specialized fields and reducers for
    tracking multi-agent conversations. It provides automatic management of turns,
    rounds, speaker history, and conversation progress through a combination of
    Pydantic fields, reducers, and computed properties.

    The state uses reducer functions for automatic field updates. When a turn is taken,
    the turn_count and speaker_history are automatically updated through reducers,
    allowing for clean state updates without manual tracking complexity.

    Attributes:
        messages (List[BaseMessage]): Conversation messages (inherited from MessagesState)
        current_speaker (Optional[SpeakerName]): The currently active speaker
        speakers (SpeakerList): List of all participant speaker names
        turn_count (TurnCount): Total number of speaking turns taken (auto-incremented)
        max_rounds (int): Maximum number of conversation rounds allowed
        topic (Optional[ConversationTopic]): The conversation topic or subject
        conversation_ended (bool): Flag indicating if conversation is complete
        mode (ConversationMode): Conversation mode identifier (e.g., "round_robin", "debate")
        speaker_history (SpeakerList): Chronological history of speakers (auto-appended)

    Computed Properties:
        round_number (RoundNumber): Current round number calculated from turns and speakers
        current_round_speakers (SpeakerList): Speakers who have spoken in current round
        remaining_speakers_this_round (SpeakerList): Speakers yet to speak in current round
        should_end_by_rounds (bool): Whether round limit has been reached
        turns_per_round (int): Number of turns in a complete round
        conversation_progress (ProgressPercentage): Progress from 0.0 to 1.0

    Reducer Functions:
        turn_count: operator.add - Auto-increment turns when state is updated
        speaker_history: operator.add - Append new speakers to chronological history
        messages: inherited from MessagesState - Accumulate conversation messages

    Examples:
        Basic usage with automatic tracking::\n

            state = ConversationState(
                speakers=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
                topic="Future of AI",
                max_rounds=5
            )

            # State automatically tracks progress
            print(f"Round {state.round_number}, Turn {state.turn_count}")
            print(f"Progress: {state.conversation_progress:.1%}")

        State updates via reducers::\n

            # Turn count automatically increments
            new_state = state.model_copy(update={"turn_count": 1})

            # Speaker history automatically appends
            new_state = new_state.model_copy(update={"speaker_history": ["Alice"]})

            # Computed properties automatically update
            print(f"Remaining: {new_state.remaining_speakers_this_round}")

    Note:
        This state uses reducer functions for automatic field updates. The reducers
        ensure consistent state evolution without manual tracking complexity, making
        it easier to build robust conversation orchestration systems.
