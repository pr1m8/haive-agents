"""Directed Conversation - Moderator-Controlled Multi-Agent Dialogue.

Conversations with explicit flow control directed by a moderator agent. The directed
conversation implements a flexible conversation pattern where a moderator agent
directs the flow of the conversation by explicitly selecting which participant
should speak next, enabling dynamic and content-driven multi-agent interactions.

Architecture:
    The directed conversation extends BaseConversationAgent with a moderator-based
    speaker selection system that allows for organic conversation development
    guided by intelligent flow control. This provides maximum flexibility for
    complex conversational scenarios that require adaptive management.

Key Features:
    - Dynamic conversation flow based on content and context
    - Moderator agent with intelligent speaker selection control
    - Targeted follow-up questions and responses
    - Conversation branching and focusing capabilities
    - Structured interviews and panel discussions
    - Conditional speaker selection based on expertise and relevance
    - Adaptive flow control with reasoning-based decisions
    - Support for multiple conversation formats and styles

Core Components:
    DirectedConversation: Main agent class that orchestrates moderator-controlled
        conversations with dynamic speaker selection and flow management.
    DirectedState: Specialized state schema extending ConversationState with
        moderator-specific fields and flow control tracking.

Flow Control:
    Unlike round-robin conversations that follow a fixed pattern, directed
    conversations allow for organic development guided by a moderator's
    intelligent decisions about which participant should contribute at each
    point based on conversation context and goals.

Usage Patterns:
    Interview-style conversation::\n

        from haive.agents.conversation import DirectedConversation
        from haive.agents.simple import SimpleAgent

        # Create participants
        interviewer = SimpleAgent(name="Interviewer", role="moderator")
        expert1 = SimpleAgent(name="Expert1", role="interviewee")
        expert2 = SimpleAgent(name="Expert2", role="interviewee")
        expert3 = SimpleAgent(name="Expert3", role="interviewee")

        # Create directed conversation
        interview = DirectedConversation(
            moderator=interviewer,
            participants=[expert1, expert2, expert3],
            topic="Climate Change Solutions",
            conversation_format="interview",
            max_rounds=10
        )

        # Run the conversation
        result = await interview.arun()

        # Access conversation data
        messages = result["messages"]
        flow_decisions = result["moderator_decisions"]

    Panel discussion format::\n

        # Panel discussion with expert moderator
        panel = DirectedConversation(
            moderator=panel_moderator,
            participants=[scientist, policy_expert, industry_rep, activist],
            topic="Future of Renewable Energy",
            conversation_format="panel",
            selection_strategy="expertise_based",
            max_rounds=15
        )

        # Run with dynamic flow control
        result = await panel.arun()

    Factory method for quick setup::\n

        # Create interview format quickly
        interview = DirectedConversation.create_interview(
            interviewer=interviewer_agent,
            interviewees=[expert1, expert2, expert3],
            topic="AI Ethics and Governance",
            max_rounds=8
        )

Conversation Formats:
    - **Interview**: One-to-many questioning with follow-up control
    - **Panel**: Moderated multi-participant discussion
    - **Q&A**: Question and answer session with dynamic selection
    - **Seminar**: Educational format with guided discussion
    - **Investigation**: Deep-dive exploration with targeted questioning

Speaker Selection Strategies:
    - **Content-based**: Select speakers based on conversation content
    - **Expertise-based**: Choose speakers based on domain knowledge
    - **Round-robin-fallback**: Use round-robin when no specific preference
    - **Random**: Random selection for exploratory conversations
    - **Custom**: Moderator-defined selection logic

Moderator Capabilities:
    The moderator agent can:
    - Analyze conversation context and determine optimal next speaker
    - Ask targeted follow-up questions to specific participants
    - Guide conversation toward specific topics or goals
    - Balance participation across all participants
    - Adapt flow based on conversation quality and engagement

Use Cases:
    - Simulating interviews with multiple subjects
    - Creating panel discussions with intelligent moderation
    - Implementing Q&A sessions with dynamic follow-up
    - Content-driven conversations where flow matters more than turn equality
    - Educational scenarios with guided exploration
    - Investigation and fact-finding conversations
    - Expert consultation with targeted questioning

Integration:
    Directed conversations integrate seamlessly with:
    - Haive core schema system for state management
    - Base conversation infrastructure for orchestration
    - Moderator AI systems for intelligent flow control
    - Content analysis tools for context-aware selection
    - Educational and training platforms
