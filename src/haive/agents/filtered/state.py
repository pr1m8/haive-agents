    State for filtered RAG agents.
    
    This state extends the base RAG state with:
    1. Filtered documents - a subset of retrieved documents that passed relevance filtering
    2. Relevance scores - numerical scores indicating how relevant each document is to the query
    3. Error tracking - any errors encountered during the filtering process
    
    The filtering process helps to:
    - Improve answer quality by focusing on the most relevant information
    - Reduce noise and hallucinations from irrelevant content
    - Provide transparency through relevance scoring
