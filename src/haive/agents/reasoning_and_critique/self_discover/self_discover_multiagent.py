"""Self-Discover Agent using the unified MultiAgent implementation.

This implementation demonstrates how to use the new MultiAgent class to create
a sophisticated reasoning system that follows the Self-Discover methodology:
1. Select relevant reasoning modules
2. Adapt modules to the specific task
3. Structure a step-by-step plan
4. Execute the reasoning plan

This showcases sequential execution with the unified MultiAgent.
