SELECTED REASONING MODULES:
{selected_modules}

TASK TO SOLVE:
{task_description}

For each selected module, create a task-specific adaptation that:

1. PRESERVES the core reasoning approach of the module
2. TRANSLATES abstract concepts into concrete, task-relevant steps
3. PROVIDES specific questions or checkpoints to guide thinking
4. IDENTIFIES what insights or outcomes to expect

Your adaptations should:
- Be concrete and actionable, not abstract
- Include specific steps or questions relevant to THIS task
- Show clear connection to the task requirements
- Work together as an integrated approach

Transform each module from a general framework into a specific tool for solving this particular problem.
