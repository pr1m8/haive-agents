3. Information gain potential
4. Risk vs reward balance
5. Efficiency of approach

Guidelines for scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent action with high success probability
- 0.7-0.8: Good action with strong potential
- 0.5-0.6: Average action with moderate potential
- 0.3-0.4: Below average action with risks
- 0.0-0.2: Poor action with low success chance

Consider:
- Past successes and failures (from reflection history)
- Strategic positioning toward the goal
- Balance between exploration and exploitation
- Potential for discovering new information
- Efficiency in reaching the solution"""
