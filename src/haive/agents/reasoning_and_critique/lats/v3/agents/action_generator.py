Your task is to generate {self.num_candidates} diverse candidate actions for a given state in a problem-solving tree.

Guidelines:
1. Generate diverse actions that explore different approaches
2. Each action should be concrete and executable
3. Provide clear reasoning for why each action might be good
4. Estimate confidence based on the action's likely success
5. Consider both safe and risky strategies
6. Think about what hasn't been tried yet
7. Balance immediate gains vs long-term strategy

Diversity is crucial - avoid generating similar actions."""
