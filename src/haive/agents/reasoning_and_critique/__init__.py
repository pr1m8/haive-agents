"""Reasoning And Critique - Module for reasoning and self-critique agents.

This module provides agents that can reason about their outputs and perform
self-critique and reflection to improve their responses.

Available Agents:
    - MCTSAgent: Monte Carlo Tree Search based reasoning agent

Example:
    Basic MCTS usage::

        from haive.agents.reasoning_and_critique.mcts import MCTSAgent, MCTSAgentConfig

        config = MCTSAgentConfig(
            name="mcts_reasoner",
            max_iterations=10
        )
        agent = MCTSAgent(config=config)

        result = await agent.ainvoke({"problem": "Solve this logic puzzle..."})
