"""Engines engine module.

This module provides engines functionality for the Haive framework.
"""

r"""LLM engine configurations for the Graph Database RAG Agent.

This module defines the prompt templates and AugLLMConfig instances for each
step in the Graph DB RAG workflow. Each engine is specialized for a specific
task in the Cypher query generation and execution pipeline.

The engines defined here are:
    - **guardrails**: Domain relevance checking
    - **text2cypher**: Natural language to Cypher conversion
    - **validate_cypher**: Cypher query validation
    - **correct_cypher**: Cypher error correction
    - **generate_final_answer**: Natural language response generation

Example:
    Using the engines in an agent::

        >>> from haive.agents.rag.db_rag.graph_db.engines import text2cypher_aug_llm_config
        >>>
        >>> # Use the text2cypher engine
        >>> cypher = text2cypher_aug_llm_config.invoke({
        ...     "question": "Who directed The Matrix?",
        ...     "fewshot_examples": "Question: Who acted in Movie X?\\nCypher: MATCH..."
        ... })
