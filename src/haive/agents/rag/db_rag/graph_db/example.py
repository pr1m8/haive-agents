"""Example usage of the Graph Database RAG Agent.

This module demonstrates various ways to use the GraphDBRAGAgent for querying
Neo4j databases with natural language. It includes basic usage, advanced
configurations, error handling, and different execution modes.

The examples cover:
    - Basic agent usage with default configuration
    - Custom domain configuration
    - Streaming execution with progress tracking
    - Batch query processing
    - Error handling and debugging
    - Performance monitoring

To run these examples:
    1. Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible
    2. Set environment variables for Neo4j connection
    3. Run: python example.py

Examples:
    Basic execution::

        $ export NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
        $ export NEO4J_USER="neo4j"
        $ export NEO4J_PASSWORD="your-password"
        $ python example.py

Note:
    These examples assume you have a Neo4j database with movie data.
    Adjust the queries and domain configuration for your specific use case.
