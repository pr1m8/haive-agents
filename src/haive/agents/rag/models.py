"""RAG Agent Models.

This module contains all Pydantic models used by RAG agents for structured
data validation and type safety. These models represent different outputs
and intermediate results from various RAG patterns.

Example:
    >>> from haive.agents.rag.models import HyDEResult
    >>> result = HyDEResult(
    ...     hypothetical_doc="Generated document content...",
    ...     refined_query="Refined query text",
    ...     confidence=0.85
    ... )

Typical usage:
    - Import specific models for agent implementations
    - Use for structured output from LLM engines
    - Validate intermediate results in RAG pipelines
    - Type hints for function parameters and returns
