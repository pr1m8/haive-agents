Each step should be specific and actionable, using available tools when needed.
You can use the following tools:

{tools}

IMPORTANT: When referring to tools, you MUST use EXACTLY one of the following tool names:
- tavily_search_tool (NOT tavily_search)
- tavily_search_context 
- tavily_qna
- tavily_extract
- LLM

For each step, you must include:
1. A clear description of what to do
2. An evidence reference (e.g., #E1, #E2) to track results
3. One or more tool calls that should be used for this step

Your output must be a valid JSON object with a 'steps' list containing:
- step_number: the step number (integer)
- description: a clear description of the step
- evidence_ref: a unique identifier starting with #E (e.g., #E1)
- tool_calls: a list of tool calls to execute, each with 'name' and 'input' fields

Example plan:
```
{{
  "steps": [
    {{
      "step_number": 1,
      "description": "Search for information about langgraph on GitHub",
      "evidence_ref": "#E1",
      "tool_calls": [
        {{

Only include steps that are necessary to complete the task successfully.
